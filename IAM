Basic Use Case of AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)

AWS IAM is used to manage access to AWS resources securely. It enables fine-grained control over who can access which resources and under what conditions.

Use Case Example:
Suppose you are part of a team developing an application hosted on AWS. Your team has developers, testers, and managers. Using IAM:  

1. User Management: You can create individual IAM users for each team member.  
2. Access Control: Assign specific permissions to each user based on their role:
   - Developers: Full access to EC2 and S3 for deploying and managing applications.
   - Testers: Read-only access to S3 to view logs.
   - Managers: View-only permissions for monitoring application performance in CloudWatch.  
3. Security: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users to enhance security.  
4. Temporary Access: Use IAM roles to grant temporary access to AWS resources without sharing credentials (e.g., for an external consultant).  

IAM ensures that every action is performed only by authorized personnel, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
