Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

Key Features:

Subnet Isolation: Divide the VPC into private and public subnets.
Customizable Network: Define your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and gateways.
Enhanced Security: Use security groups and network access control lists (NACLs) for traffic control.
Internet Gateway (IGW): Provides public internet access to resources in a public subnet.
VPN or Direct Connect: Connect your on-premises network to the AWS cloud.
Use Cases:

Hosting applications securely in private subnets.
Building hybrid cloud environments.
Isolating sensitive workloads.

[What is VPC?]  
  - Virtual network to launch AWS resources securely  
  |
  v
[Key Components]  
  - Subnets: Public/Private subdivisions of the VPC  
  - Route Tables: Direct traffic within the VPC  
  - Internet Gateway (IGW): Enables internet access  
  - NAT Gateway: Secure internet access for private resources  
  |
  v
[Benefits of VPC]  
  - Security: Isolated network  
  - Flexibility: Custom IP range  
  - Control: Manage traffic flow  
  |
  v
[Log in to AWS Console]  
  - Navigate to VPC Dashboard  
  |
  v
[Create VPC]  
  - Specify CIDR block for IP range  
  |
  v
[Set Up Subnets]  
  - Create Public Subnet (Attach IGW)  
  - Create Private Subnet (No internet access)  
  |
  v
[Configure Route Tables]  
  - Public Route Table: Connect to IGW  
  - Private Route Table: Isolate private traffic  
  |
  v
[Attach IGW to VPC]  
  - Enable internet access for public subnet  
  |
  v
[Optional: Configure NAT Gateway]  
  - Allow private subnet instances to access the internet securely  
  |
  v
[Launch Resources]  
  - Public Subnet: EC2 instance with internet access  
  - Private Subnet: EC2 instance without direct internet access  
  |
  v
[Test Connectivity]  
  - Ping public EC2 from outside  
  - Verify private EC2 is isolated
